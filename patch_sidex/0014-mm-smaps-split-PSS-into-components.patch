-		process.  The format is identical to /proc/pid/smaps,
+		process.  The format is almost identical to /proc/pid/smaps,
 		except instead of an entry for each VMA in a process,
 		smaps_rollup has a single entry (tagged "[rollup]")
 		for which each field is the sum of the corresponding
 		fields from all the maps in /proc/pid/smaps.
-		For more details, see the procfs man page.
+		Additionally, the fields Pss_Anon, Pss_File and Pss_Shmem
+		are not present in /proc/pid/smaps.  These fields represent
+		the sum of the Pss field of each type (anon, file, shmem).
+		For more details, see Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
+		and the procfs man page.

+The /proc/PID/smaps_rollup file includes the same fields as /proc/PID/smaps,
